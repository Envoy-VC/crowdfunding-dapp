# Welcome to CrowdWork üéâ

A decentralized crowdfunding app built on the Polygon Blockchain.

With CrowdWork, you can easily create and manage crowdfunding campaigns for your projects. Our smart contract ensures that funds are held securely and are released to the campaign creator only when the campaign reaches its goal or after a specified time period has passed.

# How to use the App

To begin playing with the app, set up the web3 wallets and obtain some testnet tokens.

## Setting up Wallet

First and foremost, you will require a web3 wallet. You may instal and configure Metamask by following these steps:

1. First, visit the MetaMask website (https://metamask.io/) and click on the "Get Chrome Extension" button to install the MetaMask extension for Google Chrome.
2. Click "Add to Chrome" and then "Add Extension" to install MetaMask.
3. Click on the MetaMask icon in the top right corner of your browser to open the app.
4. Follow the prompts to set up your MetaMask account. This will include creating a password and choosing a seed phrase to secure your account. Make sure to keep your seed phrase in a safe place, as you will need it to access your account if you ever lose your password.

Next, the current version of the app operates on the Polygon Mumbai testnet, so you'll need to add the network to your wallet and obtain some testnet coins before you can experiment with it.

1. Once you have set up your MetaMask account, click on the "Networks" dropdown in the top left corner of the app.
2. Click on the "Add Network" button.
3. In the "New Network" dialog box, enter the following information:
   - Network Name: Polygon Mumbai
   - New RPC URL: https://matic-mumbai.chainstacklabs.com
   - ChainID: 80001
   - Symbol: MATIC
   - Block Explorer URL: https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/
4. Click the "Save" button to add the Polygon Mumbai network to your MetaMask wallet.
5. You should now be able to switch to the Polygon Mumbai network in the "Networks" dropdown.

That's it! You should now be able to use MetaMask to interact with the Polygon Mumbai network. To get some Testnet funds just follow the following steps:-

1. To get testnet funds, you can visit the Polygon Faucet (https://faucet.polygon.technology/) and enter your MetaMask wallet address to request testnet tokens.
2. Once you have received your testnet tokens, you should be able to see them in your MetaMask wallet and use them to interact with the Polygon Mumbai testnet.
