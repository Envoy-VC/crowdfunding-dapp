A decentralized crowdfunding app built on the Polygon Blockchain.

With CrowdWork, you can easily create and manage crowdfunding campaigns for your projects. Our smart contract ensures that funds are held securely and are released to the campaign creator only when the campaign reaches its goal or after a specified time period has passed.
